      <h1>SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT</h1>
      <p>
        Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying,
        designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in
        creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software
        components. Software development involves writing and maintaining the
        source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all processes from the
        conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of
        the software, typically in a planned and structured process. Software
        development also includes research, new development, prototyping,
        modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other
        activities that result in software products.
